        <h1>About The Unity Game Engine</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>What is Unity?</h2>
            <p>Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed
                by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005
                at Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine.
                The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety
                of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms.

            <h2>What Scripting Languages do Unity Support</h2>
            <p>Unity is a native C++-built game engine, but
                You write code in:
            </p>
            <ul class="customIndent">
                <li>C#: The most Common Language</li>
                <li>JavaScript: Also known as UnityScript</li>
                <li>Boo: An Extension of C# that is rarely used</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Although there are multiple supported languages, 99% of unity developers use C#
                as there are almost no resources available for the other languages.

            <h2>Why is Unity So Useful</h2>
            <p>
                Rather than going in blind, Unity comes with a powerful
                scripting API that offers you quick access to the most
                commonly needed features. This includes both general game
                features, as well as specific API calls that allow you to
                access specific features and nuances for the engine. For
                example, you can use serialized fields to change variable values
                (like integers, strings, etc.) in the game editor GUI.

            <h2>What types of games can be made using Unity</h2>
            <p>
                Popular games Like Hollow Knight, Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, and Cuphead
                are just some examples of amazing games made completely in unity. along
                with 2D and 3D games, Unity can also make VR and Mobile AR Games that can be
                deployed across 25+ leading platforms and technologies to reach the largest
                possible audience.
